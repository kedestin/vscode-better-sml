# vscode-better-sml

Standard ML Support for Visual Studio Code

## Features

- highlighting
	- [x] precise syntax highlighting for SML based on tree-sitter
- editing
	- [x] document fomatting (enable on save with `editor.formatOnSave`)

## Changes vs. stonebuddha's version

The original version relied on hard coding styling  for 
a predetermined list vscode themes.

This version instead leverages the [Semantic Highlighting API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide) to dynamically apply Textmate scopes based on the parse tree generated by Tree Sitter.

The applied scoping is still a work in progress
